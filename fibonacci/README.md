#Task of the exercise

'Create a program that contains a recursion subroutine that calculates and prints the
members of the Fibonacci read string up to the number specified by the user. The program
asks that from the user.

The Fibonacci number sequence f (n) is defined as follows:
If n <0, then the error condition,
f (0) = 0,
f (1) = 1 and
f (n) = f (n-1) + f (n-2).'
