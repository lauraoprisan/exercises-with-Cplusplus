#Task of the exercise

'Make a program with a subroutine that checks a personâ€™s adolescence. Thus, a teenager
means a person between the ages of 13 and 19. The subroutine has the parameter age
that the program asks from the user. The subroutine can be of type int () (returns a 'true
value' of 1 or 0), bool () (returns a true value of true or false), or void () (does not contain a
return command at all).'
