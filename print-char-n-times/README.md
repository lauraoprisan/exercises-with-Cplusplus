#Task of the exercise

'Make a program with a void () subroutine that prints the desired number of characters on
the screen. The Void () subroutine has no return command at all, but it uses parameters
and performs functions like other types of subroutines. This subroutine has two
parameters: the character to be printed and the number of such characters to be printed.
The program asks the user for the character and number.'
